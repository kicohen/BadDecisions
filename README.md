Bad Decisions is an app for the time that you are feeling indecisive or a group of friends and you can't make an easy decision like what movie to see or where to go to eat. Simply open up the app and ask a question. Feel free to help others out and answer their questions as well. 

Because it is a simple app, we don't need any complex user accounts, there is no reason to hide any information behind passwords or complex logins, just create an account using your name and email and start asking and answering questions.

The app has a NodeJS, Express, Mongoose and SocketIO backend working with a MongoDB database and a custom front-end making use of the JQuery and SocketIO libraries.
